	Perform the QR factorization of a n by m matrix using Householder

	  A          the matrix;
	  diag       a vector of length n to store the diagonal of the R
	             matrix;

	             the columns of A (usefull in the Levenberg-Marquardt
	             method).
	
	On output, the upper triangular part of the A matrix is replaced by
	the R matrix except for its diagonal while the lower triangular part
	stores a factored form of the Q matrix. The diagonal elements of R
	are returned in diag and the column permutations in perm.
