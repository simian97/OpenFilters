def Gauss_Jordan(A, b = [], use = None):
	"""Perform Gauss-Jordan elimination with full pivoting.
	
	Solve the systems Ax=b where A is a n*n matrix and b is a set of m
	vector of length n. The function takes two or three arguments
	  A    the matrix;
	  b    (optional) a set of right side vectors;
	  use  (optional) a vector of length n indicating which rows and
	       columns to use, allowing the use of the same memory when
	       fixing one value in a system of equations.
	
	The solutions x are returned in the space used for b while A is
	replaced by its inverse. Use without b to simply get the inverse
	of A. The function does not return any output arguments. It will
	raise a matrix_error if the matrix is singular. A matrix is
	considered singular when a scaled pivot is smaller than machine
	precision.
	
	The values in the unused rows and columns of A and b are untouched.
	
	For a detailed description of the Gauss-Jordan method, see 
	  Press et al., Numerical Recipes in C: the Art of Scientific
	  Computing, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1997,
