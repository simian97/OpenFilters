# Initialize the abeles package.
# 
# The abeles package provides classes to calculate optical properties
# of a filter using the Abeles matrices. This file first tries to
# import the functions from a dynamicaly loaded library (_abeles.dll
# on Windows). If this fails, a Python implementation is loaded. The
# dynamicaly loaded library, written in C, is much faster than the
# Python implementation. The later is maintained to allow the use of
# this software on any system running Python, even if it is impossible
# to compile the dynamicaly loaded library. It is also usefull when
# develloping new features in Python before translating them in C.
